2023 FIFA Women's World Cup
The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup is the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup,
the quadrennial international women's football championship contested by women's national
teams and organised by FIFA. The tournament, which is taking place from 20 July to 20 August 2023,
is jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.
It is the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation,
as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations,
as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation.
In addition, this tournament is the first to feature the expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24,
replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022.
The opening match was contested between New Zealand and Norway at Eden
Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023. The final which is to be contested between Spain and England
will take place on 20 August 2023 at Stadium Australia in Sydney.
Of the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round
of 16 (where they lost to France). The United States were the two-time defending champions,
but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals
at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.
With two-time champions Germany, 1995 champions Norway, and 2011 champions Japan all eliminated by the
quarter-finals, the winner will take their first title.
