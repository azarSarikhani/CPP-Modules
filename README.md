# CPP-Modules
This repo consists of 10 C++ modules. The goal of these modules is to introduce us to object oriented programing. Concepts like inhertance, polymorphism, templates, static classes, are among the covered topics.
Classes had to be written in orthodox canonical form, with copy constructors and operator overloads. And just so that concepts are learnt better everything had to be c++98 compatible.
